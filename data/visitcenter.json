To the northeast, Eagle Mountain stands lofty as a rugged backdrop. Weather can be extreme. Summers are blistering, with bright sunny weather and temperatures exceeding 100 degrees daily. Winters are cool to cold, with strong winds and sub-freezing nights. Snow is possible. The occasional rainstorm poses the threat of flash flooding. There is abundant flora and fauna nearby. Desert wilderness surrounds the visitor center. Around the building we find short desert plants. There are cacti and various flora with thorns and sharp points. Cat\u2019s-claw acacia and many of the shrubs can be unforgiving if brushed up against. There are also plants native to the Mojave, such as yucca, juniper, and sage. In spring, red berries appear on the purple bush. Prince\u2019s Plume are adorned with yellow flowers. The ironwood trees near the Bajada Nature Trail sprout pink and purple flowers. After a rain, the Ocotillo grow red flowers and green leaves. The Prince's Plume, ironwood trees, and Ocotillo are native to the Colorado desert. Gambel\u2019s Quail call out throughout the day, often scurrying around the parking lot. Mule deer, coyotes, and even bighorn sheep frequent the nearby landscape. Throughout the day ravens and turkey vultures soar overheard. Black-tailed jackrabbits nervously hop along, as a red-tail hawk eyes it\u2019s next prey from the sky. In the warmer months, rattlesnakes and desert tortoise roam the nearby sandy trails. There are three one-story buildings that comprise the visitor center facilities: The visitor center, a restroom, and a staff office. From the parking area, the visitor center is located to the left. The restroom is situated to the right of the visitor center and 30 feet across from the parking lot. The men\u2019s restroom is located on the left side of this building, and the women\u2019s restroom is located on the right side. There are picnic tables and bulletin boards between the restrooms and the office to the right. The visitor center also serves as a gift shop and fee-entrance station. The door is located on the south side of the building. As you enter, there is a brochure table 6 feet from the inside of the door. On the right side of the building you will see interpretive panels with information about the geology, history, and geography of Joshua Tree National Park. On the walls on the south and east side of the building are panels with quotes about the park. This side also has displays with merchandise sold by the Joshua Tree National Park Association. The front counter is 25 feet from the door where you can buy park passes and merchandise. A window on the west side of the building that has been modified to receive payments for entrance fees, directly to the left of the front counter. Plexiglass hangs around the front counter for the protection of staff and visitors. The building has standard lighting and when the blinds are up, the outside sun provides ample illumination. To the right of the front counter there are more displays for merchandise. On the east wall, there is a window with a majestic view of Eagle Mountain, Mastodon Peak, and the surrounding desert. South of this window there is a bookcase with various publications on Joshua Tree National Park. In the center of the visitor center there is a life-sized mold of a desert tortoise enclosed in glass. On the west side, to the left of the brochure table, there is a window. Next to this window there is a fold-out sign that says \u201cEncuentra Tu Parque\u201d (\u201cFind your Park\u201d in Spanish). There are more store displays as you make your way closer to the front counter. There is a small, slightly shaded courtyard in-between the visitor center and the offices. There are creosote bush and beavertail cactus in the middle. A small bench is located about 10 feet to the north of the offices. There is also a bulletin with park information, maps, and trail guides. All facilities are accessible through paved and level walkways. Outside of the visitor center, there are sidewalks between the parking lot and the buildings. The parking lot has 2 handicapped spaces, with accessible ramps and paved paths to the visitor center, restroom, and office. The office is restricted to park staff and those with authorization to enter. To the right of this building is a flagpole and a sign showing air quality and fire danger. There is also a sign that displays fees to enter the park. There is a short tenth of a mile dirt nature trail that is immediately east of the visitor center. The trail is a loop that starts a few feet from the paved path that leads to the main entrance. It ends on the east side of the parking lot. There are signs along the way identifying various plants and shrubs that can be found in the area.

From the intersection, heading south on Park Boulevard, the visitor center is on the right. The gravel parking lot, just south of the visitor center, can comfortably fit 40 cars. There is a curved cinder block wall that divides the parking lot from the visitor center. From the parking lot, there is a cement sidewalk leading a short distance through a modest cactus garden and ends at a small cement courtyard in front of the visitor center on the east side of the building. In the garden stands a flagpole and a rusted metal sculpture. The exterior of the single-story visitor center has walls that resemble corrugated metal. From the courtyard, another short cement sidewalk leads through a large wooden gate into an outdoor patio between the cinder block wall and the south side of the building. The patio is enclosed on its south end by the previously mentioned cinder block wall. Inside the patio, the ground is dirt and slopes down from the cinder block wall towards the double glass doors that lead into the visitor center. Two tables are on the patio near the doors where rangers can help visitors with information. Once entering the building, there is a one-room exhibit area with panels depicting geology, ecology, and history of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a life-sized replica of a Joshua tree accompanied with panels about the Joshua tree. There is a guitar and a U2 record album on display that represents the creative aspects of Joshua Tree National Park. There is a television that plays a 2-minute video about the park\u2019s geology. The exhibit opens into the one-room bookstore. On display are souvenirs\u2014stickers, patches, t-shirts, hats, stuffed animals, mugs, postcards, and books. On the side of the bookstore closest to the exhibit is a counter with three cash registers.

The main Oasis Visitor Center entrance is closest to the parking lot. Visitors walking from the parking lot will find the main entrance on their right. The main entrance consists of glass double doors that open outward. The other entrance to the visitor center is a few steps away, around the corner on the west side of the building. This side entrance is a single glass door that opens outward. The pathway continues past both doors and to a patio with several picnic tables. The back patio leads to the Oasis of Mara Nature Trail. Both entrances open-up to a shop that sells books and other souvenirs. Straight ahead from the main entrance is the register where one can purchase their souvenirs or a pass to enter the park.

It is an L-shaped wooden building. The building has brown, planked wood siding. If facing the front of the building, four upper, clerestory windows are visible near the peak of the roof. A lower roof overhangs the front of the building, supported by beams and posts, creating a covered walkway. Along that walkway, at ground level, five windows alternate with five doors. Two wooden benches along the exterior wall provide seating. At the bend of the L-shape is a 10-foot by 10-foot structure that sticks up about 10 feet taller than the roof. Sticking up from it are several tall rods and a shallow, concave-shaped satellite dish. An outdoor lamp attached to the side. <br /><br />In front of the station is a picnic table and a flagpole, flying the United States flag. On the left side of the walkway is a low wire frame platform. Mounted on top of this is a large brush, made of stiff blue plastic spikes, used to clean off the bottoms of boots.

Behind it is a thick section of trees. In the distance, to the left, is a large hill.The text reads,Learn more about ranch history, including a complete map and guide to the ranch area, in the Santa Rosa Island Interpretive Guide.The guide also provides detailed information on island Chumash history, military history, and natural history. In addition, it serves as a trail guide for the 1.75 mile hike from the pier to Water Canyon Beach via Cherry Canyon.Borrow the guide and return it or take it home and donate at ciparkfoundation.org/join-support/.Below and to the left of this panel is a small metal box with a locked panel in front, and a slanted top with a slit in the center, about three inches wide. To the right of this box is a wall mounted plastic holder that contains the guides. This exhibit panel, titled \"Channel Island Ranchos,\" provides cultural history about Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island.The panel background is a faded sepia photo, in shades of brown. It shows a steep, rocky shoreline, with a wooden staircase rising from the beach to the rocky plateau above. On the plateau are a large, long building, two smaller buildings, and canvas tents. The text reads:Santa Cruz Island covers almost 61,000 acres, its fertile central valley girded by rugged mountains, reaching 2,434 feet.Santa Rosa Island encompasses over 54,000 acres, of strikingly different topography - rolling grassy hills, mesas with deep-cut arroyos, and dunes that shift in the almost continuous winds.The Early Years.Humans inhabited the Channel Islands as early as 12,000 years ago. In 1542, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo found populous Chumash villages on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands. The waters of the Santa Barbara Channel teemed with marine life, and the Channel Islands were regular ports of call for fur traders, hunters, and fishermen in the late eighteenth century, although most trade was illegal under both Spanish (1769 to 1821) and Mexican (1821 to 1848) rule. The sea otter population experienced a serious decline by 1820 and the seals by 1830. By 1810 the islanders, victimized by European disease and their economy disrupted, began to migrate to the mainland at the urging of Franciscan padres.", "isPassportStampLocation": "1", "passportStampLocationDescription": "", "passportStampImages": [{"credit": "", "description": "", "crops": [{"aspectRatio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/passport_stamps/primary/D14A8CFF-949C-2695-EC3F321159095A79.jpg"}], "altText": "Visitor Contact Station Stamp", "title": "Visitor Contact Station Stamp", "caption": "", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/passport_stamps/D14A8CFF-949C-2695-EC3F321159095A79.jpg"}], "geometryPoiId": "", "amenities": ["Animal-Safe Food Storage", "Audio Description", "Benches/Seating", "First Aid Kit Available", "Historical/Interpretive Information/Exhibits", "Information", "Information - Maps Available", "Picnic Table", "Scenic View/Photo Spot"], "contacts": {"phoneNumbers": [{"phoneNumber": "805-658-5730", "description": "", "extension": "", "type": "Voice"}], "emailAddresses": [{"description": "", "emailAddress": "chis_information@nps.gov"}]}, "directionsInfo": "This visitor center can only be visited by boat.
