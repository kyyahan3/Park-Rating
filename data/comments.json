I recommend getting tickets online ahead of time, up to a week just in case weather changes, so you don\u2019t have to wait in the lines to purchase tickets the day of and most likely will have to choose a later tour time (tickets were about $50-60/person for the day tour).

It is advised to bring a sweater/jacket as it gets really windy and chilly up in the building and wear comfortable running shoes. You\u2019ll be walking up an inclined slope appx 13 stories to the top of the hill, to the main building and throughout the building. The condition of the building and maintenance of the structure was in great shape, despite weathering through the years and tours.

There is a bookstore and gift shop with souvenirs as well as plenty of areas for beautiful pictures of the Sf Shoreline from the hill.

The historical value of showing how fear and racism could envelop a country, because of the color of their skin or shape of their eyes was a tragedy. Being there, reading their stories, seeing their pictures, looking at all the names of the individuals that were interned there was sad. I actually got choked up to know that our own government did this to this to their own citizens. They had to get rid of all their possessions and take only what they could carry on their backs... sad. Being able to tour and walk a little(because of the heat) of the camp doesn't do justice because there isn't much standing except replicas of a few buildings. But after seeing documentaries, visiting the visitor center, reading and listening to their stories gives you an idea what it felt like to be there. We walked a little, sat at some benches and just imagined what they must've gone thru, truth is we couldn't, it had an eerie sound when the breeze blew. We want to go back when it's cooler and walk the compound, yes it looks huge but that's with no buildings so you could only imagine what it looked like with the many buildings and over 10,000 people.

Currently the exhibit only includes information about tribal people as war enemies and anthropological objects of study (tools, etc), which is a fairly common but very colonial way to talking about Indigenous people/nations.
