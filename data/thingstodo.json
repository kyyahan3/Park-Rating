While the footing is typically even, rain and heavy traffic can make the trail muddy and rutted in various sections. The trail/road\u00a0is eight to ten feet wide in most places, and traverses through open grasslands, shrubs, and forests.

Visit Point Reyes National Seashore's <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/planyourvisit/pets.htm\">Pets</a> page for additional regulations and safety tips.) The Bolinas Ridge Trail is a current ranch/fire road that is shared with bike and horse riders. Most of the northern part of the trail passes through active cattle pastures. Grazing cattle may be present; give them plenty of space when passing. This is an out-and-back trail (although connecting trails offer the opportunity of loop hikes), so it provides visitors with the flexibility to choose how long they want to make their adventure. The Bolinas Ridge trail spans\u00a011 miles (17.6 km) from its <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/golden-gate-bolinas-ridge-trailhead.htm\">northern trailhead</a> along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard to its southern terminus on the Fairfax-Bolinas Road. Turn around and retrace your steps whenever you are ready. The trail description below proceeds from north to south.</p> <p>The Bolinas Ridge Trail's northernmost 2.4 miles (3.8 km)\u00a0pass through grasslands, gradually increasing in elevation. Due to the absence of trees, this section offers some of the best views along the trail of Olema Valley to the west, Tomales Bay to the northwest, and Black Mountain to the north.</p> <p>The Bolinas Ridge Trail\u00a0intersects\u00a0with the Jewell Trail 1.4 miles (2.2 km) from the northern trailhead. The Jewell Trail\u00a0leads east and downhill to Lagunitas Creek and the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walk-the-cross-marin-trail.htm\">Cross Marin Trail</a>. If you don't mind walking 0.7 miles (1.2 km) along Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, follow Jewell Trail to Cross Marin Trail to Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and back along the road to the trailhead for a\u00a04.3-mile-long (6.9-km-long)\u00a0loop hike.</p> <p>The Bolinas Ridge Trail continues south from the Jewell Trail junction with grasslands initially on both sides of the trail. The trail begins to run along the edge of a Douglas fir and coast redwood forest 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the northern trailhead. The trail skirts along the edge of the woods, staying mostly out from under the tree canopy for the next 3.3 miles (5.3 km).</p> <p>The Shafter Grade Road/Trail descends to the east 5.1 miles (8.2 km) from Bolinas Ridge Trail's northern trailhead. The Shafter Grade connects with the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/walk-the-cross-marin-trail.htm\">Cross Marin Trail</a> at the southeast boundary of Samuel P. Taylor State Park and provides options for loop hikes in excess of 10.3 miles (16.5 km).</p> <p>The Bolinas Ridge Trail more completely enters the forest 5.7 miles (9.1 km) south of its northern trailhead. South of here, far-reaching views are few and far between.</p> <p>The Randall Trail descends west to Highway 1 (aka Shoreline Highway) 0.5 miles (0.8 km) later. Continuing south through the forest for another 1.6 miles (2.6 km) brings the hiker to the McCurdy Trail, which similarly descends west to Highway 1. Starting from either the Randall or McCurdy Trailheads, combining the appropriate sections of the Randall, Bolinas Ridge, McCurdy, and Olema Valley Trails results in an 8.1-mile-long (13-km-long) loop hike.</p> <p>The Bolinas Ridge Trail remains in the forest for another 1.7 miles (2.7 km) as it winds to the south before encountering a drier 1-mile-long (1.6-km-long) section of the ridge dominated by fragrant chaparral. From a few sections of this part of the trail, one can look south to Bolinas Lagoon, Stinson Beach, Bolinas Bay, and the Pacific Ocean. Hikers will reenter the redwood forest and find shade along the southernmost 0.5 miles (0.8 km) of the Bolinas Ridge Trail and at the small parking area along the Fairfax-Bolinas Road.</p> <p>This route description alone is not a substitute for a trail map.

A light spinning reel and nimble rod are a good choice for casting long distances and a sporting fight.</p> <h4>Fly Fishing</h4> <p>Manzanita Lake is nationally known for its fly-fishing opportunities. For fly fishing, a six-weight rod is recommended with a length of 9 to 10.5 feet with a #5 or #6 leader. Due to the abundance of willows around the lake, fly fishing can be challanging. Waders are advised. Most flies will work, however a few popular flies that work throughout the park are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Callibaetis (#16-18)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Damsel Nymph (#14)</p> </li> <li> <p>Parachute Adams (#14-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Traditional Adams (#16-20)</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibaetis Cripple (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Carpenter Ant (#14-16)</p> </li> <li> <p>Bouface brown (#10)</p> </li> <li> <p>Monroe leech, olive (#10)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>\u00a0Manzanita Lake Specific Flies:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p>Midge Patterns</p> </li> <li> <p>Pupa Patterns,</p> </li> <li> <p>Callibraetis Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Damselfly Nymphs</p> </li> <li> <p>Stripping Nymphs,</p> </li> <li> <p>Leech Patterns\u00a0</p> </li> <li> <p>Wooly Buggers</p> </li> </ul>", "reservationDescription": "<p>There are no reservations for park entrance or for fishing.</p>", "season": ["Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "1608649A-E7D7-4529-BD83-074C90F9FB68", "name": "Fish"}, {"id": "1CF1F6BB-A037-445B-8CF2-81428E50CE52", "name": "Lakes"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "false", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "0-10 Hours", "credit": "", "relevanceScore": 1.0}, {"id": "6EC45499-0614-47FD-88FA-99030DE130C0", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/hikebumpasshell.htm", "title": "Hike to Bumpass Hell", "shortDescription": "Hike the three-mile, round-trip trail to the largest hydrothermal area in the park.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/cropped_image/AF2554D6-E2E8-061C-B230DA644291DFB9.jpg", "credit": "", "altText": "Four young kids hiking on a trail backed by a large volcanic peak and rocky, tree-lined slopes.", "title": "Bumpass Hell Trail", "description": "", "caption": "Bumpass Hell Trail is popular with hikers of all ages.", "crops": [{"aspectRatio": "1.78", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/cropped_image/primary/AF2554D6-E2E8-061C-B230DA644291DFB9.jpg"}, {"aspectRatio": "1", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/cropped_image/secondary/AF2554D6-E2E8-061C-B230DA644291DFB9.jpg"}]}], "relatedParks": [{"states": "CA", "parkCode": "lavo", "designation": "National Park", "fullName": "Lassen Volcanic National Park", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/lavo/index.htm", "name": "Lassen Volcanic"}], "relatedOrganizations": [], "tags": ["trail", "hydrothermal areas", "hydrothermal features", "scenic view", "volcanoes"], "latitude": "", "longitude": "", "geometryPoiId": "", "amenities": [], "location": "Bumpass Hell Trail and Basin", "seasonDescription": "<p>The trail to reach Bumpass Hell is at a high elevation and receives significant snowpack.

One of the largest contributers to this diversity is the huge range of elevations and associated habitats present (over 11,000 ft/ 3353 m). From the creosote-studded sands of Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, to the riparian oasis at Darwin Falls, to the bristlecone forest crowning Telescope Peak, many habitat types mean many bird species which call Death Valley home.\u00a0<br /> <br /> In addition to year-round residents such as ravens and roadrunners, Death Valley's water sources are also a vital resource for migratory birds, many of which can be spotted in the spring and fall.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Spring Migration</strong><br /> For a few weeks in the spring, hundreds of species pass through desert areas. The first of the northbound spring migrants can be seen as early as the beginning of March, with migration fully ramping up by mid-March to early April. The first wave of warblers reaches the valley about mid-April. The northbound movement reaches its peak from late April to early May.<br /> <br /> <strong>Nesting</strong><br /> Nesting occurs from mid-February (during warm springs) at lower elevations, through July at higher elevations. May through June is the most productive nesting period.<br /> <br /> <strong>Fall Migration</strong><br /> There is definite evidence that the fall migration is underway by early August. Southbound movements are at a peak near the end of September. However, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate between northbound and southbound movements. Late spring migrants may still be moving north as early fall migrants begin their southward journeys. There is also the post-nesting summering visitors which may be mistaken for early southbound migrants.<br /> <br /> <strong>Winter</strong><br /> November through March is probably the poorest season for birding; a few permanent residents remain, as well as occasional Sierran visitors. The majority of the park's avifauna can be found at the low mountain springs and desert oases. Furnace Creek Ranch, with its diversity of habitats is a hot spot. Springs occuring up to approximatley 4,000 feet (1,219 m) elevation are also common wintering habitats.<br /> <br /> <strong>Where to look for birds</strong><br /> Visiting the following areas provides an overview of the diversity of Death Valley habitat and avian species:<br /> <br /> Saratoga Spring (60 ft. elevation)\u2013 a low desert oasis.<br /> <br /> Furnace Creek Ranch (-200 ft. elev.) \u2013 multiple lush habitats; visit the bird viewing platform next to Airport Road. <em>Note: please do not enter the golf course unless golfing.</em><br /> <br /> Scotty\u2019s Castle (3,000 ft. elev.) \u2013 riparian habitat.\u00a0<em>(currently closed due to flooding)</em><br /> <br /> Wildrose (4,000 ft. elev.) \u2013 riparian habitat.<br /> <br /> High Panamints: Charcoal Kilns to the top of Telescope Peak (elevations from 7,000 \u2013 11,000 ft)\u2013 this challenging drive / hike passes through pinyon-juniper habitat to bristlecone pine communities (recommended during clear / non-snow conditions only).<br /> <br /> Use this Death Valley <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/deva/learn/nature/upload/DEVA-Bird-List-508.pdf\">bird list</a> to keep track of species you observe.", "reservationDescription": "", "season": ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"], "topics": [{"id": "957EF2BD-AC6C-4B7B-BD9A-87593ADC6691", "name": "Birds"}], "durationDescription": "", "arePetsPermitted": "true", "timeOfDay": ["Day", "Dawn", "Dusk"], "duration": "", "credit": "", "relevanceScore": 1.0}, {"id": "1E5AE6B8-CD0F-4A44-96F7-F21B470988D8", "url": "https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/kayak-drakes-estero-and-estero-de-limantour.htm", "title": "Kayak Drakes Estero and Estero de Limantour", "shortDescription": "Kayaking or canoeing Drakes Estero and Estero de Limantour offers an intimate marine wilderness experience unlike any other.\u00a0Kayaking and canoeing is permitted in Drakes Estero and Estero de Limantour from July 1 through February 28; closed March 1 through June 30.", "images": [{"url": "https://www.nps.gov/common/uploads/cropped_image/900FBC28-A7BD-33D5-F34C3B76EFE193B8.jpg", "credit": "NPS/A.

The four Richmond shipyards produced 747 ships, more than any other shipyard complex in the country. Richmond was also home to over 56 different war industries, more than any other city of its size in the United States. The city grew from less than 24,000 people in 1940 to nearly 100,000 people by 1943, overwhelming the available housing, roads, schools, businesses and community services. At the same time, Executive Order 9066 forcibly removed Japanese and Japanese-American residents from the area, disrupting Richmond\u2019s thriving cut-flower industry.

Much of this area through which this route passes was burned in the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/firemanagement_woodwardfire.htm\">Woodward Fire</a>, which was started by\u00a0lightning strikes in August of 2020.</p> <p>Start at the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-bear-valley-trailhead.htm\">Bear Valley Trailhead</a> and follow the relatively flat Bear Valley Trail south. A short distance beyond a sign indicating you are entering the Phillip Burton Wilderness, you will get to choose between two routes that will lead you to the Sky Trail along the crest of Inverness Ridge.</p> <ol> <li>Turn right on to the Mount Wittenberg Trail 0.2 miles (0.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a more strenuous ascent of about 1,130 feet (~340 m) over a distance of 1.8 miles (2.9 km). While the Woodward Fire burned along most of the length of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, it primarily burned in the understory and left most of the canopy of the Douglas fir forest intact. As a result, there are very few far-reaching views from this trail until you reach the ridge crest. Remain on the Mount Wittenberg Trail at the Z Ranch Trail junction, which is located at the highest point along this route with an elevation of 1270 feet (385 m).* From the crest of Inverness Ridge along the western 0.4 mile-long (0.6-kilometer-long) leg of the Mount Wittenberg Trail, you may be rewarded (weather dependent) with views looking west across the peninsula to the Pacific Ocean. The Mount Wittenberg Trail intersects with the Sky Trail 0.4 miles (0.6 km) beyond the Z Ranch Trail junction and 2.4 miles (3.8 km) from the Bear Valley Trailhead.<br /> *From Mount Wittenberg-Z Ranch Trail junction, the 0.3-mile-long (0.5-kilometer-long) Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail\u00a0leads, as its name suggests, to the summit of Mount\u00a0Wittenberg (elevation 1407 feet (426 m). The once unobstructed views from near the summit have, since 2000, become obstructed by dense Douglas fir thickets that sprouted shortly after the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/firemanagement_visionfire.htm\">1995 Vision Fire</a>. While the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/pore/learn/management/firemanagement_woodwardfire.htm\">2020 Woodward Fire</a> burned through much of the forest around Mount Wittenberg, the view-obstructing Douglas fir thickets were largely left unscathed. So, without being rewarded with\u00a0views for their effort, many hikers pass on ascending the Mount Wittenberg Summit Trail.</li> <li>Turn right on to the Meadow Trail 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the trailhead if you want a slightly easier climb over Inverness Ridge. Similar to the Mount Wittenberg Trail, the Woodward Fire mostly impacted the understory of the forest along the Meadow Trail. While the trail does pass through a fairly large meadow (after which the trail was named), views from the meadow are of forested hillsides less than a mile distant. The Meadow Trail ascends about 840 feet (~255 m) over a distance of 1.6 miles (2.6 km) before intersecting with the Sky Trail 2.4 miles (3.8 km)\u00a0from the Bear Valley Trailhead. The elevation at this intersection is ~1080 feet (~327 m).</li> </ol> <p>Both the Mount Wittenberg Trail and the Meadow Trail intersect the Sky Trail at the same large trail junction. Turn left (south) on to the Sky Trail and follow it for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to its junction with the Woodward Valley Trail. Once hemmed in by a ~six-foot-tall (~two-meter-tall) hedge of huckleberry bushes, the Woodward Fire cleared out most of the shrubs and a lot of the lower branches of the trees in this area so that this section of trail feels a bit more open than it did before 2020.</p> <p>Turn right (west) on to the\u00a0Woodward Valley\u00a0Trail, which was one of the lushest, greenest trails in the park before the Woodward Fire.\u00a0The Woodward Valley Trail descends about 800 feet (~240 meters) over a distance of 2.0 miles\u00a0(3.2 km)\u00a0before intersecting with the Coast Trail,\u00a0where you will turn left/south. Open ocean views are plentiful along the last\u00a00.5 miles (0.8 km)\u00a0of the Woodward Valley Trail and along the length of the Coast Trail as you pass through coastal grasslands intermixed with some coastal scrub.</p> <p><s>The Sculptured Beach Trail branches off after 0.5 miles (0.8 km), leading down to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-sculptured-beach.htm\">Sculptured Beach</a>, where there are <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/point-reyes-tidepooling.htm\">tidepools</a> exposed\u00a0at low tides.\u00a0A second location to descend to a beach occurs 2.5 miles (4 km) later when you reach the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-kelham-beach.htm\">Kelham Beach</a> Trail junction.</s>\u00a0<span style=\"color:#990000;\">The\u00a0Sculptured Beach and Kelham Beach Trails are\u00a0indefinitely closed due to storm damage.</span>\u00a0</p> <p>Continuing south on the Coast Trail for another 0.9 miles (1.5 km ) brings you to the Coast-Bear Valley Trail junction. Turn left on to the Bear Valley Trail and follow it 4 miles (6.4 km) east and north back to the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot. The Bear Valley Trail has a gentle grade as it first follows Coast Creek to Divide Meadow and then gradually descends along Bear Valley Creek for the final 1.6 miles (2.6 km) of this hike. Aside from the large meadow at Divide Meadow, the trail passes through a beautiful forest of buckeyes, oaks, and Douglas firs.</p> <p>Restrooms and water are available at the Bear Valley Trailhead parking lot.

Beyond the footbridge to the beach, the trail is covered in sand, progressively getting deeper the closer one gets to the beach. Limantour Beach itself is composed of loose sand, which may be firmer below the high tide line. As one gets closer to Sculptured Beach, the slope of the sand below the high tide line tends to get steeper. And a short distance east of the path leading to Coast Campground, the beach starts transitioning from all sand to rock outcrops, making passage in a beach wheelchair more challenging to impossible. There are two designated accessible parking spaces at Limantour Beach. There are six vault toilets adjacent to the accessible parking spaces, which in and of themselves were designed to be accessible, but the surface between the parking spaces and the vault toilets is unpaved soil that gets muddy when wet, and, therefore, is not smooth.</p> <h2>From the Coast Trailhead</h2> <p>The Coast Trail from the Coast Trailhead doubles as an eight-foot-wide (2.4-meter-wide)\u00a0service/fire road that is composed of compacted dirt and gravel (and potholes and washboarding). Otherwise, the Coast Trail's northern 2.8 miles (4.5 km) is relative flat; the steepest section is at the Coast Trail's junction with the Laguna Road where the trail drops relatively steeply from the built-up road to the valley floor.

It has a gravel surface and has space for a couple hundred vehicles.</li> <li>A small paved parking lot is located\u00a0at the end of a spur road that leads east from Limantour Road just before one reaches the main lot. This parking lot only has 16 parking spaces. If you arrive early enough to park in one of these spaces (or are lucky to find a space later in the day), the hike to and from Sculptured Beach will be ~0.8 km (1.3 km) shorter roundtrip.</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-laguna-trailhead.htm\">Laguna Trailhead</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-coast-trailhead.htm\">Coast Trailhead</a></li> </ul> <h2>Directions to Sculptured Beach</h2> <p>There are dozens of hiking routes that lead to Sculptured Beach. Even from the three closest trailheads (routes from which are described below), there are six or more different combinations of hiking on trails or walking on the beach that will get one to and from Sculptured Beach. This is due to how the Coast Trail runs parallel to the beach with three locations at which one can descend from the trail to the beach.</p> <h3>Beach Access Trails that connect with the Coast Trail</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail:</strong> This short connector trail is ~0.6 miles (0.9 km) from the small paved lot or ~1 mile (1.6 km) from the main parking lot at Limantour Beach. Or, if hiking from the Coast Trailhead, follow the Coast Trail for 1.9 miles (3 km). Or, if coming from Coast Campground, follow the Coast Trail west for 1.1 miles (1.8 km) or walk west on the beach for 0.8 miles (1.3 km). Look for a lone large pine tree growing on the edge of a low bluff. Just west of the tree is a 100-foot-long (30-meter-long) sandy path leading from the beach to Coast Trail.</li> <li><strong>Coast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail:</strong> The second location to connect between the beach and the Coast Trail is at the Coast Campground. From the Coast Trail, a 600-foot-long (180-meter-long) dirt path branches off of the Coast Trail to the north of site 8, passing to the left of some hitching rails and, further along the path, to the right of a lone eucalyptus tree. This path descend along the east side of a creek that flows down to Santa Maria Beach. From the beach, this path isn't as obvious, especially if one is walking along the water's edge. Pay attention to the height of the bluffs. To the west of this beach access, the bluffs are significantly lower than to the east. The creek can also serve as a landmark. During drier periods, the creek's water may not stay above the surface of the beach all the way to the bay, but during the winter and spring, water from the creek will frequently flow over the sand to the bay, forcing one to get at least the soles of their shoes wet as they cross the creek. Coming from the west, it will be the first significant creek that flows onto the beach east of Limantour Beach's parking lots. Coming from the west, the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail is ~1.4 miles (2.2 km) from Limantour Beach's small parking lot and ~1.8 miles (2.9 km) from the main lot, and 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail. Coming from the east (e.g., from Sculptured Beach), it will be the second creek one crosses after leaving Sculptured Beach, which is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) away.</li> <li><strong>Sculptured Beach Trail:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"color:#990000;\"><strong>Indefinitely closed due to storm damage.</strong></span> The 0.2-mile-long (0.3-km-long) Sculptured Beach Trail descends from the Coast Trail 1.3 miles (2.1 km) southeast of Coast Campground. Or, if one has walked on the beach from the west and wants to ascend to the Coast Trail, look for a wooden stairway leading up from Sculptured Beach 0.8 miles (1.3 km) east of the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail. These stairs are at the north end of a deeper sandy cove just west of some off-white-colored low-profile promontories that stretch out into the bay.</li> </ol> <h3>Directions from the Limantour Beach parking lots</h3> <p>Follow the path from either parking lot at Limantour Beach to the beach and head southeast on the beach for 2.1 miles (3.4 km) if you started from the smaller paved parking lot or 2.4 miles (3.8 km) if you started from the main parking lot. So long as the tide is low enough, you should be able to walk along the water's edge all the way to Sculptured Beach. If the tide is high, you may need to leave the beach at the locations described above and hike along the Coast Trail.</p> <ul> <li><s>From the Coast Trail's Limantour Beach Access Trail, head southeast (to the right toward Coast Campground) on the Coast Trail for 2.4 miles (3.8 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction.</s></li> <li><s>From the Coast Campground's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail, turn right on to Coast Trail and follow it 1.3 miles (2.1 km) to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction.</s></li> </ul> <p><s>At the Sculptured Beach Trail junction, turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.</s></p> <h3>Directions from the Laguna Trailhead</h3> <p>This\u00a0route steadily ascends the 0.8-mile-long (1.3-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Laguna Trail to a 400-foot-high (120-meter-high) ridge crest from which Drakes Bay is visible. The route then descends via the 1-mile-long (1.6-kilometer-long) southern leg of the Fire Lane Trail to the Coast Trail just north of the Coast Campground. Turn left on the Coast Trail for 0.1 miles (160 m) to reach the Coast Campground and it's Santa Maria Beach Access Trail. One now has a choice:</p> <ol> <li>Descend to the beach and walk along the water's edge for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) to get to Sculptured Beach. (This route is dependent upon the tide being low enough for safe passage along the base of the bluffs.) Or</li> <li><s>Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for a total of 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground\u00a0and the Woodward Valley Trail junction\u00a0to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.</s></li> </ol> <p>Return via either route to get back to the Coast Campground, where you can either return to the Laguna Trailhead via the Fire Lane and Laguna trails. Or follow the Coast Trail to the Coast Trailhead, across Laguna Road from the Point Reyes Hostel. Turn right on to Laguna Road and walk a short distance along the road to return to your vehicle.</p> <h3>Directions from the Coast Trailhead</h3> <p>Follow the Coast Trail for 2.8 miles (4.5 km) alongside a stream and then through bluff-top coastal grasslands to the Coast Campground. (As described above, one may descend to the beach after hiking 1.9 miles [3.1 km], if one so desires.) <s>Continue southeast on the Coast Trail for another 1.3 miles (2.1 km) through and past the Coast Campground\u00a0and past the Woodward Valley Trail junction to the Sculptured Beach Trail junction. Turn right and follow this path for 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Sculptured Beach.</s>\u00a0To return to the Coast Trailhead, retrace your steps. Alternatively, as described above, there are a number of other options, including returning via the Fire Lane and Laguna Trails to make your hike more of a loop hike. To do so, turn right onto the Fire Lane Trail 0.1 mile (0.2 km) west of the Coast Campground and follow the Fire Lane Trail and then the Laguna Trail\u00a01.8 miles (2.9 km) back to the Laguna Trailhead. Walk through the Laguna Trailhead parking area to Laguna Road, turn left, and follow the road back to your vehicle at the Coast Trailhead.</p> <p>The Coast Trail is a family-friendly, multi-use trail on which bicycles are allowed as far as Coast Campground. There is a bike rack bollard to which one may lock their bicycles near the Santa Maria Beach Access Trail junction.

The falls are a dramatic sight as water cascades over a ~40 foot (~12 m) cliff onto a beautiful sandy beach. Bear in mind, getting there is no easy trek\u2014a 13 mile (20 km) minimum round-trip hike is required, and you must time your visit to the falls with low tide. On weekends, and in the summer, the trailhead parking lots can fill up early in the morning. The best thing you can do to guarantee a safe, fun visit to the falls is to be prepared.</p> <p>To get to Alamere Falls, you can start at one of three trailheads\u2014Palomarin, Bear Valley, or Five Brooks. The following directions from any of these trailheads will bring you to Wildcat Campground. The last part of the journey, from Wildcat Campground to the base of the falls, is the same regardless of which trailhead you choose.</p> <p>These\u00a0route descriptions alone are not a substitute for a trail map.

The Coast Trail then heads inland and drops into a small valley before ascending switchbacks up the other side. Climb over a pass, and hike past a number of small ponds before reaching Bass Lake after 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of hiking. In another 0.6 miles (1 km) arrive at a view of Pelican Lake. Continuing on 0.8 miles (1.3 km) leads to the junction with the Ocean Lake Loop Trail. Stay right to remain on the Coast Trail as it heads a bit further inland through coastal scrub and forest, or turn left on to the Ocean Lake Loop Trail, which drops initially to pass by Ocean Lake, but then climbs steeply to reach the top of some coastal bluffs with views looking up and down the shoreline. Both routes reconnect after 1.1 miles (1.7 km). After this point you'll be back on the Coast Trail for a final 0.2 miles (0.3 km) to Wildcat Campground.</p> <h3>From Bear Valley Trailhead</h3> <p>Follow the relatively flat Bear Valley Trail south \u00a0for 3.1 miles (5 km) to the Glen Trail. Turn left onto the Glen Trail and begin climbing up the side of a ridge. After 0.6 miles (1 km), keep right to stay on the Glen Trail. After another 0.4 miles (0.6 km) keep left to stay on the Glen Trail. Hike for 0.5 miles (0.8 km) to the intersection with the Stewart Trail. Turn right and follow the Stewart Trail 1.2 miles (1.9 km) downhill to get to Wildcat Campground.</p> <h3>From Five Brooks Trailhead</h3> <p>Follow the Stewart Trail northwest for 0.3 miles (0.5 km) to the junction with the Olema Valley Trail. Keep right to stay on the Stewart Trail as it begins a long climb up the side of Inverness Ridge. After 0.8 miles (1.3 km), the Greenpicker Trail branches off to the right at a switchback. Hikers may wish to shorten their hike by 0.7 miles (1.2 km) by following the Greenpicker Trail to the top of the ridge, but be forewarned that the Greenpicker Trail is steeper than the Stewart Trail. Alternatively, continue on the Stewart Trail as it switchbacks 2.6 miles (4.2 km) up the side of the ridge to Fir Top, the highest location (1324 ft/404 m) along the southern end of Inverness Ridge. Due to the dense Douglas fir forests, there are no far-reaching views. Hikers on the Greenpicker Trail can return to the Stewart Trail at this location. Continue straight on the Stewart Trail as it descends 2.7 miles (4.3 km) from the top of the ridge to Wildcat Campground.</p> <h2>The Hike from Wildcat Beach to the Falls</h2> <p>A well-worn trail leads along the south side of Wildcat Campground to the beach. From there, walk south for 1.1 miles (1.7 km) during a low tide to reach the base of the falls. If you arrive at Wildcat Beach and find that the waves are reaching the base of the bluffs, do NOT attempt to walk to Alamere Falls. If the tide is heading out, you could wait until the water level is low enough to allow safe passage along the beach. Be prepared to wait a while. If the tide is coming in, you may wish to come back on a future date rather than waiting for the tide to peak and then retreat.

The occasional storm will start rolling through in late October, bringing clouds, wind, and rain. The strongest winds occur in November and December during occasional southerly gales.</p>", "accessibilityInformation": "<p>Point Reyes National Seashore's hiking trails vary in quality, width, grade, and slope. Many are single-track with rough, uneven surfaces with lots of tree roots or other obstacles or tripping hazards. However, each campground is serviced by a multi-use maintenance road that is over eight-feet-wide and may be accessible to those in wheelchairs or those who wish to ride a bicycle to the campground. Accessibility for those routes are described below.</p> <h2>Campground Facilities</h2> <p>Each campground has two vault toilets and a water faucet from which potable water is usually available. While the vault toilet buildings are in and of themselves designed to be accessible, the unpaved ground and terrain around the toilets do not meet the standards to qualify as accessible. While the ground around the water faucets may be relatively flat, it is unpaved and does not meet the standards to qualify as accessible.</p> <h2>Campsites</h2> <p>A few campsites at each of the four campgrounds has relatively flat ground throughout the campsite and a relatively flat approach to the campsite, but none of the campsites meet accessibility standards. Each campsite has a picnic table and food storage locker. Campsites at Coast, Glen, and Wildcat campgrounds also have raised charcoal grill. None of this equipment meets accessibility standards.</p> <h2>Routes to the Campgrounds</h2> <h3>Coast Trailhead to Coast Campground</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.8 miles (4.5 km) one way, relatively flat</p> <p>The Coast Trail from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-coast-trailhead.htm\">Coast Trailhead</a> doubles as an eight-foot-wide (2.4-meter-wide) service/fire road that is composed of compacted dirt and gravel (and potholes and washboarding). The Coast Trail's northern 2.8 miles (4.5 km) is relative flat; the steepest section is at the Coast Trail's junction with the Laguna Road where the trail drops relatively steeply from the built-up road to the valley floor. The road-side parking at the Coast Trailhead is on the shoulder, which has surfaces that are uneven and sloped.</p> <h3>Five Brooks Trailhead to Glen Campground</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.7 miles (9km) one way, very steep</p> <p>The Stewart Trail, Glen Trail, and Glen Camp Loop Trail to Glen Camp are old ranch roads that are currently maintained as multi-use trails for the public and as service roads for NPS vehicles to drive from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-five-brooks-trailhead.htm\">Five Brooks Trailhead</a> to Glen Campground. The trails tend to be at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide throughout their duration. The trails' surfaces are comprised of compacted dirt and gravel. Since the Stewart Trail ascends from ~260 feet (79 meters) to 1,324 feet (404 meters) in elevation in a bit more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) and due to the steep grades along many sections of the route to Glen Campground, it will likely be very challenging for someone in a wheelchair without assistance.</p> <h3>Sky Trailhead to Sky Campground</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 1.4 miles (2.3 km) one way, moderately steep</p> <p>The Sky Trail is an old ranch road and its northern 1.4 miles (2.2 km) is maintained as a service road for NPS vehicles to drive from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-sky-trailhead.htm\">Sky Trailhead</a> to Sky Campground. The trail tends to be at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide with a substrate of dirt and gravel. Since this section has a change in elevation of about 350 feet (106 meters), it may be challenging for someone in a wheelchair without assistance.</p> <h3>Five Brooks Trailhead to Wildcat Campground</h3> <p><strong>Distance:</strong> 6.7 miles (9km) one way, very steep</p> <p>The Stewart Trail to Wildcat Camp is an old ranch road that is currently maintained as a multi-use trail for the public and as a service road for NPS vehicles to drive from the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/places/point-reyes-five-brooks-trailhead.htm\">Five Brooks Trailhead</a> to Wildcat Campground. The trail tends to be at least 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide throughout it's duration. The trail surface is comprised of compacted dirt and gravel. Since this trail ascends from close to sea level to 1,324 feet (404 meters) in elevation in a bit more than 3 miles (5 kilometers) and due to its steep grades along many sections of the route, it will likely be very challenging for someone in a wheelchair without assistance.</p>", "isReservationRequired": "true", "ageDescription": "<p>All ages.

This is an important time for many visitors to ask themselves, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/hyperion.htm\">Should I Hike To Hyperion?</a><br /> <br /> <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/redw/planyourvisit/hyperion.htm\">Remember to stay on trail.\u00a0</a><br /> <br /> Luckily, there are many other trails in the redwood parks that are easier to access and physically easier to hike. These other trails will also will lead you to equally beautiful old-growth redwood groves.\u00a0If you want our best suggestion for an alternative to the Tall Trees Trail, we suggest the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/thingstodo/prairie-creek_foothill-trail.htm\">Prairie Creek-Foothill Trail Loop</a>. It is very easy to get to, it has redwoods just as tall, and that loop is much easier on the knees and heart.<br /> <br /> The Tall Trees Trail is a moderately strenuous hike that descends 800-feet down to the alluvial floodplain of Redwood Creek. The grove has plenty of water, good soil, and protection from winter winds and as a result has many redwood trees that exceed 350 feet (106 meters) in height.<br /> <br /> The grove was featured in a famous 1963 National Geographic Magazine article that helped propel a public push for the creation of Redwood National Park.\u00a0The tallest tree in the world is not located in the Tall Trees Grove.\u00a0After the discovery by the National Geographic survey team, the tree known as the Libby Tree,\u00a0or \"Tall Tree\", held the title until 1994 when the top died back, dropping it down to the 34th tallest tree on the planet.\u00a0<br /> <br /> <strong>Be Prepared: </strong>Make sure you have food, water, sturdy shoes, raingear, and a flashlight.<br /> <br /> <b>Access:</b>\u00a0Allow a 1-hour drive (including 7-miles on a dirt road) from the nearest visitor center to the trailhead. The road to the Tall Trees trailhead is a narrow and windy. <strong>The small parking lot does not accommodate RVs over 21 feet or vehicles towing trailers.</strong> There is a locked gate at the top of the road to manage the traffic and to avoid overcrowding.<br /> <br /> We recommend that visitors <u>do not rely on digital maps</u> to find your way to the gate - digital map accuracy and data coveage in our area is poor.

You may want to check out this crossing before starting your hike to determine which direction you will go. If you attempt to cross the creek at the start of the hike and you do get your feet wet, you may not enjoy the hike as much as you hike for the next\u00a07.4 miles\u00a0(12 km) with wet footwear. If you decide to cross the creek at the end of your hike, you won't have\u00a0too\u00a0much further\u00a0to walk before you can change out of your wet footwear at your vehicle.</p> <p>If you choose to hike the route clockwise, head south on the Muddy Hollow Trail for 0.3 miles (0.5 km) through a riparian (e.g., streamside) zone to the junction with Estero Trail. The Estero Trail heads west out of the valley floor through some coastal scrub and young Bishop pine woodlands up and over a 370-foot-high (112-meter-high) ridge before descending into another valley and crossing the Glenbrook Creek after 2.2 miles (3.5 km). There may be standing water on the trail in the Glenbrook Creek area during winter and spring.</p> <p>Just beyond the Glenbrook Creek is the site of the New Albion Ranch, which is significant as the first dairy on Point Reyes,\u00a0perhaps in Marin County.\u00a0All that remains of the ranch, however, are eucalyptus trees that were planted to protect the ranch from the wind.</p> <p>Continue south 0.4 miles (0.6 km) toward the estero (which is Spanish for estuary) and Drakes Bay before making a sharp bend to the north. The trail runs fairly straight along a low ridge crest before intersecting with the Glenbrook Trail in 1.1 miles (1.7 km). The forested ridge in the distance to the north is the northern end of Inverness Ridge, which reaches heights of 1282 feet (388 meters) at Mount Vision and 1336 feet (405 meters) at Point Reyes Hill. The route described on this page will ultimately follow along the western base of this ridge, but won't ascend to its crest.</p> <p>At the Glenbrook Trail junction, you could turn left to stay on the Estero Trail and return via the White Gate and Muddy Hollow Road trails\u2014doing so would add an extra 2 miles (3 km) to your hike. Or continue straight along the ridge crest as the Glenbrook Trail leads 0.6 miles (1 km) north to the Muddy Hollow Road Trail. Turn right and follow the Muddy Hollow Road Trail as it meanders 2.3 miles (3.7 km) along the base of Inverness Ridge back to the trailhead.</p> <p>The Bucklin and Bayview Trails connect with the Muddy Hollow Road\u00a0Trail and offer routes to ascend to the crest of Inverness Ridge, which would add another ~4 to ~6 miles (6.4 to 9.6 km) to your hike.</p> <p>This route description alone is not a substitute for a trail map.

Beyond the footbridge to a junction with Limantour Spit Trail, the trail is covered in sand, progressively getting deeper the closer one gets to the beach. Beyond the junction, one will need to climb up and over a small sand dune and then traverse dozens of yards/meters to reach the water's edge. There are two designated accessible parking spaces. There are six vault toilets adjacent to the accessible parking spaces, which in and of themselves were designed to be accessible, but the surface between the parking spaces and the vault toilets is unpaved soil that gets muddy when wet, and, therefore, is not smooth.</p> <h2>Drakes Beach</h2> <p>The parking lot at Drakes Beach is immediately adjacent to the beach, but there are no routes onto the beach that would qualify as accessible. There are a number of short sandy paths ranging in length from a few yards (meters) to close to 50 yards (45 meters) leading from the paved sidewalk to the sandy section of the beach. Most paths tend to be narrow, rutted, lined with ice plant, and may be strewn with driftwood. The shortest route to the sandy\u00a0\u00a0beach is free of most of these obstacles, but has a slope that far exceeds 5%.\u00a0Accessible toilets are available in the restrooms adjacent to the Kenneth C. Patrick Visitor Center.</p> <h2>Heart's Desire</h2> <p>Heart's Desire Beach has three accessible parking spaces. A paved path leads 100 feet (30 meters) toward the beach. Depending on the level of the tide, the water's edge is another 70 feet (21 meters) or more beyond the end of the paved path across sand. The restrooms are accessible, although the asphalt path leading to restrooms does not fully meet accessibility standards. Along the paved path from the parking lot to the beach is a paved picnic area with three picnic\u00a0tables, a bench,\u00a0and two charcoal grills (as of April 2022).</p> <h2>Shell Beach</h2> <p>There are no accessible facilities at Shell Beach. Shell Beach is 0.3 miles (0.5 kilometers) via a an earthen trail from the small paved parking lot at the north end of Camino del Mar.</p> <h2>Alan Sieroty Beach at Millerton Point</h2> <p>The parking lot at Millerton Point is largely composed of gravel, but there is a paved accessible parking spot adjacent to an accessible vault toilet building. Otherwise, there are no accessible facilities at Millerton Point. Paths to the beach are earthen and vary in width and grade.</p> <h2>Chicken Ranch Beach</h2> <p>There are no accessible facilities at Chicken Ranch Beach. The parking area is a wide section of roadside shoulder that is mostly composed of gravel. A steep, narrow, earthen path leads down from the road, crosses a foot bridge, and arrives at a sandy section of beach after about 50 yards (45 meters).

Continuing on 0.8 miles (1.3 km) leads to the junction with the Ocean Lake Loop Trail. Stay right to remain on the Coast Trail as it heads a bit further inland through coastal scrub and forest, or turn left on to the Ocean Lake Loop Trail, which drops initially to pass by Ocean Lake, but then climbs steeply to reach the top of some coastal bluffs with views looking up and down the shoreline.

Due to the dense Douglas fir forests, there are no far-reaching views. Hikers on the Greenpicker Trail can return to the Stewart Trail at this location.
